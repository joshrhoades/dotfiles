# This script configures my Node.js development setup. Note that
# nvm is installed by the Homebrew install script.
#
# Also, I would highly recommend not installing your Node.js build
# tools, e.g., Grunt, gulp, WebPack, or whatever you use, globally.
# Instead, install these as local devDepdencies on a project-by-project
# basis. Most Node CLIs can be run locally by using the executable file in
# "./node_modules/.bin". For example:
#
#     ./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.local.config.js
